Just as I've approved additional support for Iraqi forces against isolation. We decided to increase the support. For local forces fighting ourselves serious. A small number of American special operations forces are already on the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces of driven ice. Out of careers. So given the success. Approved the deployment of up to one hundred and fifty. Additional U S personal. In Syria including special forces to keep up this moment. They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground. But. They will be essential. In providing the training and assisting local forces they continue to drive ourselves back. So my normal stake this terrorists will learn the same lessons others before them have. Which is? Your hatred is no match for our nations united in the defense of our way of life. And just as we remain relentless on the military front we're not going to give up on diplomacy to end the civil war.
